Stepped into the world of magic with Harry Potterâ€™s first book. It was amazing, so much better than the movie with lot more drama, magic and different sides of characterâ€™s that I never knew.

For years I wasnâ€™t able to read books just because I was chasing productivity/non-fiction with the purpose of bettering myself. I believe for me personally, when I do something for myself, for the love of doing it, then it becomes so much more enjoyable and I still learn in the process.

This is a re-start to my reading journey, after a small hiccup. To many more good reads ðŸ’«
