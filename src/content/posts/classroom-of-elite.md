“ Social Darwinism “ , Manipulation, Elitism and Deceit at its best.

Presented in a classroom setting but this pretty much mirrors reality where people may use diverse strategies to accomplish what they want based on their value system. I was almost about to quit in Season 1 but the last episode is where everything changes.

Every episode starts with a quote, and man I love these stories which talk on social commentary and human nature.
