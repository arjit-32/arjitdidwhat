For past couple of days, I have been puzzled about the nature of Human Relationships. The sole fact that how quickly are people forgotten once they stop existing. It lays a profound question of how many of our actions are dictated due to these relationships, when eventually they along with you are going to get vanished.

Humans are social animals, yes they are because thats how the species survived. But in todayâ€™s day and age, these relationships which seemed like a cornerstone of our existence are showing its true transactional nature.

Maybe the acceptance of fragile relationships are, is all we need to lift the veil of this illusionary human construct masking our inherent loneliness.

How different our actions will be, or our goals if we break past these illusions. What will fulfilment to us be when we know that we wont be remembered more than few minutes once we leave. Will this lead us to misery due to the curse of our genes of finding a society or lead us to more genuine, deeper bonds and a fulfilled life.
