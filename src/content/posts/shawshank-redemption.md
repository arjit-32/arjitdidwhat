Today I rewatched an absolute favourite movie of mine. This gem of a movie has so many themes - they way it makes you think about freedom, patience as a virtue, or how knowledge is indeed a power, the many faces people wear, corruption and the misuse of power humans do.

Even though Andy was in jail he still set up the library, helped the society and people around him. Him getting his friends cold beer or playing music to make them feel the freedom he had in his heart. “There are some things they can never take from you, its hope “ he says.

Even though everyone around him had accepted fate, he had hope. The shine in his eyes when he talked about freedom. Some birds aren’t meant to be caged he was one such bird.

While Brooke decided to quit, Andy showed Red who was going on the same path that he can hope for good things too. Hope is best of things, it never dies.

At last my friends “ Get busy living or get busy dying “
