What a day it was, had one of the craziest experiences of travelling alone. Travelling first time all by myself in metro to waiting hours for a bus to Doon. Finally got a crappy bus and that too because didnt give up in the face of trouble. Asked the right question without hesitation and Bam ! Just saved myself trouble of finding another bus. Learnt how travelling is so much easier now with internet, it must have been so difficult earlier.
Will appreciate everytime I get to commute easily without giving a fight.
