I registered for the CAT exam, primarily because I wanted to support a friend of mine.

Another reason was it seemed like a good opportunity for me to work on my analytical and logical skills. The goal I kept was 90%(percentile) without any prep or can say almost negligible prep. 

For those who don’t know percentile is relative metric with respect to all test takers, so a 90 percentile would mean higher score than 90% of test takers.

I took a week off from office. I planned the syllabus I would be covering and was totally pumped to get started, but then out of nowhere I fell sick, I contracted cough and cold. I couldn’t study a lot, but with limited time I was giving in my sickness I tried to mainly work on Quantitative topics like prime numbers, divisibility rules and factorials. If I have to estimate I roughly spent around 10 - 20 hours in the whole week at max. 

*( Mocks Given - 2 full length, 4 Quant, 2 LRDI, 2 VARC tests )*

Coming to the grand finale, the test day. I reached the location and this feeling was very familiar, but this time with no pressure of performing well. The test centre as usual was not that great, with invigilator wasting initial few minutes in getting signs. I finished the test, came out of the test center and then went on with my life. 

On 19/Dec results were released, I scored 54%icle (verbal being around 75). I did not expect anything apart from wishful thinking of getting in 90s, but this was really bad. 

What did I learn from it ? 

- No amount of wishful thinking can replace hardwork.
- I am decently good in verbal so probably should double down on it.
- I have yet to work on my analytical skills and it will take constant practice.
