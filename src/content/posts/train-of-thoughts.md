Sitting with coffee in my hand. Itâ€™s drizzling and every so often the gusts of wind hit my face. Lost in a world inside my head where the boundaries between real and a dream fade away. Dreams, oh yes lots of them. Few fulfilled and many forgotten. Is there an end to such dreams, will achieving them fulfill my heart. Still we will run after those, maybe these dreams are what living is. The endless chase of dreams and moments lived within is what gives meaning to our existence.
