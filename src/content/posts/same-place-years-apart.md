When I first arrived in Blr(2022), I went for a run in a Park. As i was running towards a building, a sense of familiarity hit me. This subconscious memory of being in the same place in past. Soon I realised that it was for a college trip couple of years ago. This exact place I was walking with friends, laughing about something trivial yet joyful. This milli-second flashback took me to the past as I kept running.

I recently experienced the same feeling again when I was dropping a friend to the blr station. A strange mix of familiarity and errieniess.

This feeling was more than a fleeting recognition. It felt like convergence of timelines. The people have changed, life moved on yet the past still stands or dare I say is interwoven in most beautiful and delicate way possible. Its moment like these that occur rare but are beautiful in its own way.
