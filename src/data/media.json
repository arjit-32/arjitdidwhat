    "description": "Running my first 10k without any prior preparation is something Ill never forget. It felt so difficult at a point that everything was blurred out, but kept pushing kept moving through the pain and doubts.Its funny how running replicates life in so many ways.Someone will always be ahead of you, the moment you focus on them you lost your own race. Everyone is running their own race, fighting their own demons yet the unexplainable feeling of fulfilment is the same. So just focus on being a slight better than yesterday’s you.The last photo is the finishing 10-20 meters.",
